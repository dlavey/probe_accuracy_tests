# Automated probe accuracy testing

`probe_accuracy_test_suite.py` is a collection of tests to help checking probe accuracy, precision and drift under different conditions.

## Default Tests Included

* 1 test, 30 samples at each bed mesh corners - check if there are issues with individual z drives.
* 20 tests, 10 samples at bed center - check consistency within normal measurements
* 1 test, 100 samples at bed center - check for drift

## Changelog

I'm making updates as I receive feedback from the community on what tests are actually useful

* 2022-06-09: Allow passing probe_accuracy parameters and generating statistics on repeatability tests

## Installation

On your printer:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sporkus/probe_accuracy_tests/master/install.sh | bash
```

will clone/pull this repo and install the necessary python packages.

## How to Use

Use `~/probe_accuracy_tests/run_probe_accuracy_test_suite.sh --help` to see all the options.

### Tests

* Run all three tests: `~/probe_accuracy_tests/run_probe_accuracy_test_suite.sh`
* Enable tests individually with `--corner`/`-c`, `--repeatability`/`-r`, `--drift`/`-d`
* Test parameters can be further specified:
  * corner test, 10 samples each: `--corner 10`
  * 5 Repeatability tests: `--repeat 5`
  * 50 probe samples drift test: `--drift 50`

### Other options

* add `--speedtest` to test a range of z-probe speed. Speed parameters are entered in interactive menu.
* add `--force_dock` to force probe docking between tests to check docking issues.
* add `--export_csv` to export data as csv.
* add `--speed`/`-retract` for probe speed/retract distance override.
* add `--keep_first` to force keeping first probe sample even if it's configured to be dropped normally.
* add `-output_dir`/`-o` to change the output directory. Use this to save the graphs to a place easily accessible to you.

## Requirements

### Python

See [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)

They will installed by installation script above. If they are not installed - they can be installed like this manually.

```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```

### Printer

* Need klicky macros properly configured, so that homing/leveling/probe accuracy gcodes
will pick up the probe safely.
* There was an issue that prevented running `PROBE_ACCURACY` near the front of the bed in [klicky-macros.cfg](https://github.com/jlas1/Klicky-Probe/blob/main/Klipper_macros/klicky-macros.cfg).  This was fixed on 2022/05/30.  Please update your config file if you see this error msg: `Must perform PROBE_ACCURACY with the probe above the BED!"` .

### Output

All graphs and data are saved to `/tmp`. Enable csv export with `--export_csv` flag.

#### Interpreting results

* The green area is the middle 50% range of your samples. The narrower this band is, the more precise your probe is.
* The red area falls outside of median +-0.005mm. If you have a lot of samples in the red area, you MAY have issue (but not necessarily).
* Graphs are fancy and helpful to find glaring issues, but it is unnecessary to chase the most perfect graphs.
* If your repeatability range is 0.1mm or less, it should be sufficient to produce a good bed mesh. Increasing probe sample count (set in `printer.cfg` > `[probe]` > `samples`) can help sometimes.

#### Common Issues

* Getting probe sample exceeding samples_tolerance error? Try increasing `[probe]:sample_tolerance` to 0.02. This has no effect on the actual accuracy of your probe.
* On Voron V2 printers, the most common issue is loose z-belts. An example from a printer with loose belt will look like the below image:
